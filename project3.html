        <h2>Phishing website detection using Machine learning and DS </h2>
        <div class="item"><b>Objective or Description</b>
            <div class="info">The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a website is a phishing website or not. Phishing websites are fraudulent sites that trick users into giving up their personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item"><b>Tools & Technologies</b>
            <div class="info">

                <b>Python:</b> The main programming language for data processing and machine learning.<br>
                <b>Scikit-learn:</b> A Python library for machine learning and predictive data analysis.<br>
                <b>Pandas:</b> A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.<br>
                <b>NumPy:</b> A Python library for numerical computations.<br>
                <b>Matplotlib/Seaborn:</b> Python libraries for data visualization.<br>
                <b>Jupyter Notebook:</b> An open-source web application for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item"><b>Concepts to be used</b>
            <div class="info"><b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Cleaning and formatting the data to be fed into the machine learning model.<br>
                <b>Feature Engineering:</b> Creating new features from the existing data to improve the performance of the machine learning model.<br>
                <b>Machine Learning Algorithms:</b> Using algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc. to train the model.<br>
                <b>Model Evaluation:</b> Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.<br>
                <b>PhishTank API:</b> An API that provides access to PhishTank’s database of known phishing URLs. This can be used to gather data for the project.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item"><b>Roles</b>
            <div class="info"><b>Member 1:</b> Responsible for data collection and preprocessing. This includes gathering data using the PhishTank API and cleaning the data.<br>
                <b>Member 2:</b> Responsible for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. This includes analyzing the data to find patterns and creating new features.<br>
                <b>Member 3:</b> Responsible for building the machine learning model. This includes choosing the right algorithm, training the model, and tuning the parameters.<br>
                <b>Member 4:</b> Responsible for evaluating the model and presenting the results. This includes calculating performance metrics and creating visualizations to present the results.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item"><b>WorkFlow</b>
            <div class="info"><b>Data Collection:</b> The project starts with data collection. You will use the PhishTank API to gather a list of URLs that are known phishing sites. You will also need a list of legitimate URLs. These two datasets combined will form your raw data.<br>

                <b>Data Preprocessing:</b> The raw data is then preprocessed. This involves cleaning the data (removing duplicates, handling missing values, etc.) and transforming the URLs into a format that can be used for machine learning. This might involve extracting features like the length of the URL, the number of subdomains, whether it contains an IP address, etc.<br>
                
                <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> EDA involves analyzing the data to find patterns and relationships that might be useful for the machine learning model. This could involve creating visualizations, calculating correlations, etc.<br>
                
                <b>Model Building:</b> Once the data is ready, it’s time to build the machine learning model. You will split your data into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the model and the test set is used to evaluate its performance.<br>
                
                <b>Model Evaluation:</b> After the model has been trained, you will evaluate its performance on the test set. You will use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure how well the model is doing.</div>
