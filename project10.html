        <h2>Data breach alert system</h2>
        <div class="item"><b>Objective or Description</b>
            <div class="info"><b>Project Description:</b> The Data Breach Alert System is a comprehensive tool designed to monitor various public databases and forums for data breaches and alert users if their information appears in a new breach. The system will use web scraping to gather data, machine learning algorithms for data analysis, and a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item"><b>Tools, Technologies, concepts and workflow</b>
            <div class="info"><b>Web Scraping:</b> Use web scraping tools to gather data from various public databases and forums where data breaches are often shared. You could use Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for this.<br>

                <b>Data Processing:</b> Clean and organize the scraped data. This could involve removing irrelevant information, sorting the data, and more. Python’s Pandas library can be useful for this.<br>
                
                <b>Data Analysis:</b> Analyze the processed data to identify if any user information has been compromised. This could involve pattern recognition or even machine learning algorithms. Python’s Scikit-learn library can be useful for this.<br>
                
                <b>User Interface:</b> Develop a user interface where users can enter their information (like email addresses) to be monitored. This could be a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
                
                <b>Alert System:</b> If the system identifies any compromised user information, it should alert the user. This could be an email alert or a notification in the user interface.<br>
                
                <b>Database Management:</b> Store the user information and any identified breaches securely. You could use a database system like MySQL or MongoDB for this.<br>
                
                <b>APIs:</b> Consider using APIs that provide access to known data breaches like “Have I Been Pwned API”.<br>
                
                <b>Security:</b> Ensure that all user data is handled and stored securely. This is crucial when dealing with sensitive information.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item"><b>Role of team members</b>
            <div class="info"><b>Student 1 -</b> Web Scraping and Data Collection: This student will be responsible for developing and implementing the web scraping tools that will gather data from various public databases and forums. They will use Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.<br>

                <b>Student 2 -</b> Data Processing and Analysis: This student will clean and organize the scraped data. They will also analyze the processed data to identify if any user information has been compromised. They will use Python’s Pandas library for data processing and Scikit-learn library for data analysis.<br>
                
                <b>Student 3 -</b> User Interface and Alert System: This student will develop a user interface where users can enter their information to be monitored. They will also implement the alert system that will notify users if their information is found in a new data breach. They will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.<br>
                
                <b>Student 4 -</b> Database Management and Security: This student will be responsible for storing the user information and any identified breaches securely. They will also ensure that all user data is handled and stored securely. They could use a database system like MySQL or MongoDB for this.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item"><b>Use Cases</b>
            <div class="info"><b>User Registration:</b> Users can register to the system by providing their email address and other optional information.<br>

                <b>Data Breach Monitoring:</b> Once registered, the system will continuously monitor various public databases and forums for any signs of the user’s information.<br>
                
                <b>Data Breach Alert:</b> If the system identifies any compromised user information, it will alert the user via an email alert or a notification in the user interface.<br>
                
                <b>User Dashboard:</b> Users can log in to their dashboard to see the status of their data breach monitoring and any alerts.<br>
                
                <b>Data Update:</b> Users can update their information in the system to be monitored.</div>
